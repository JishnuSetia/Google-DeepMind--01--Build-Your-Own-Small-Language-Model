# 🧠 Build Your Own Small Language Model (SLM)

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my work from the **Google DeepMind course: _Build Your Own Small Language Model_**.  
The course provides a hands-on introduction to how language models work — from probability-based word prediction and n-grams to training and evaluating a small language model using modern machine learning pipelines.

The project combines **theory, labs, experiments, and ethical reflection**, focusing on building intuition for language models rather than treating them as black boxes.
